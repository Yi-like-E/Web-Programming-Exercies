# Web-Programming-Exercies

These are the practices I have done from following web programming class examples.

These practices include javascript problem solving, HTML5 to create some simple webpages, 
manipulation with css to mimick some sites like youtube, 
form validation with HTML5 and using some API with DOM to create an interactive webpage.
