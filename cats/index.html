        <h1>Cats Sleep Anywhere</h1>
        <div id="poem-text">
            <p>Cats sleep anywhere, any table, any chair.
                Top of piano, window-ledge, in the middle, on the edge.
                Open draw, empty shoe, anybody's lap will do.
                Fitted in a cardboard box, in the cupboard with your frocks.
                Anywhere! They don't care! Cats sleep anywhere. </p>
